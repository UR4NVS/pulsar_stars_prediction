# pulsar_stars_prediction
This repository contains 2 files of a machine learning algorithm. One called "final" which is a version without annotation, the other one is a kind of draft where I explain with annotation in French how I proceeded. This machine learning algorithm stand for predicting a pulsar star by entering data into it. This algorithm was fully generated by a computer, this is an experiment ! NOT REVIEWED BY A DATA SCIENTIST OR OTHER SPECIALIST, PLEASE CONSIDER USING IT FOR EXPERIMENTATION. DO NOT USE IT FOR REAL ASTROPHYSICS RESEARCH.
